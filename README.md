# React Map project

## About This Project

This project uses React and the Yelp API to search for Vets in El Paso, Texas, and display those results in a Google Map.

The results are shown in a list on the left side of the page along with markers on the Google Map. Clicking on a map marker or one of the Vet names in the list will open a popup in the Google Map showing more information about that Vet.

A filter input lets you filter the results both in the list and the map.

## Usage

To use this project:
* clone or download the repository
* update `src/env.js` with a Google Maps API key and Yelp API key.
* run `npm start` in the directory where you cloned the repository.
